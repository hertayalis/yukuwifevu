"I was shooting for Glamour and 17, so I'd be 14 years-old leaving school, running up to New York and appearing in magazines,” she says of the opportunity that caused some jealousy.&nbsp;"Now I'm older I get it, it's fine, but it was harder when I was growing up, being proud of the things I was doing but knowing there were some people that were not as excited as I was."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1c42afdf7c2f-jasmine-saunders-and-hailey-z.jpg><p id=eyA3hL_lmd-s data-wc=7><strong>The model poses with friend Hailey Bieber</strong></p><p id=e2czjTqtQJON data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>This exciting Topshop news ties in SO perfectly with payday</a></p><p id=eUox05Z0-j30 data-wc=73>Jasmine, who was born in Germany and moved to the US when she was two-years-old,&nbsp;has a 'Made in Germany'&nbsp;tattoo on her upper arm. "I'm not sure if it has anything to do with my dad being ex-military, but I was like ‘Let me get a stamp’. I wanted to let everyone know that I was repackaged and shipped to North Carolina when I was little – and was stamped in Germany."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0cf91d6da970-jasmine-saunders-z.jpg><p id=eihRme9BW2zY data-wc=100>Growing up Jasmine was always sporty, although now due to her job she avoids the "rough and tumble"&nbsp;sports that may cause bruising. However, she does reveal some unique measures she goes to, to stay in shape. "There are workouts you can do on a plane," she says.&nbsp;"I get up and do squats in the little kitchen area. Or I'll try to find somewhere that I can do an elevated pushup. Or if I have a lay-flat bed - you might see me do crunches on the bed. I've also pulled out my resistance bands on a plane before."&nbsp;</p><p id=e05S099Xmbre data-wc=16><strong>To read the full&nbsp;interview,&nbsp;pick up the September edition of Hello!
