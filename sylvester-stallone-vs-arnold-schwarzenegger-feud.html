Over the years, both Sly and Arnie have had their share of injuries and ailments.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>For example, while making "Rocky IV," Stallone was put in the ICU for days after his co-star, Dolph Lundgren, punched him during a fight scene. Among his other injuries, Stallone has damaged his shoulders, rotator cuff, knees, and has gotten stitches on his hand and under his arm. He also suffered a hairline fracture in his neck during the making of "The Expendables." Meanwhile,&nbsp;<a href=#>Schwarzenegger has had his share of bodily damage</a>, including&nbsp;a hip replacement, rotator cuff surgery, and broken bones. Schwarzenegger has also dealt with some major heart issues. He underwent a pulmonary valve replacement in 1997, had&nbsp;update on that surgery in 2018, and had&nbsp;an aortic valve replacement in 2020.</p><p>Perhaps it was inevitable, then, that Arnie and Sly would find themselves getting surgery at the same time. In 2012, in a strange twist of fate, both men&nbsp;were in the same hospital at the same time, and both were going under the knife for shoulder surgery. Unbeknownst to either of them, their surgeries were scheduled back-to-back. For an added surprise, sources cited by <a href=#>Yahoo! News</a> claimed that Sly waited his turn until Arnie woke up from his operation. Just another casual meet-up for these action stars.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtjZ4N0gY6ssKWulajBpr6MrKuapJyku6Z51axkmqqepLmledKcn7CZoq%2Byr7HGoJyrZZaawqV7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nvidia-shield-review-tegra-4-crossroads-pc-mobile-gaming.html><span>←</span><span>Battery Life - NVIDIA Shield Review: At the Crossroads of PC and Mobile Gaming</span></a>
