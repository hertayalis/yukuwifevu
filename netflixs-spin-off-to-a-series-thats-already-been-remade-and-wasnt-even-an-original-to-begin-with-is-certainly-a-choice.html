In isolation, it makes sense to continue telling stories in what’s proven to be one of the platform’s most consistently successful arenas, but it becomes a touch more cynical when you break it down.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=306 data-current-count=606 data-injectable=true>Given his fate in the final minutes of Money Heist‘s second part, what we have here is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the prequel spin-off to a show that didn’t even originate as a Netflix exclusive</a>, with the company stepping in to acquire the production and distribution rights from Antena 3 following the first 15 episodes.</p><p data-characters=310 data-current-count=310 data-injectable=false>Not only that, but it was already given a fresh coat of paint through remake Money Heist: Korea – Joint Economic Area, without even mentioning documentary Money Heist: The Phenomenon, which reflected on how an unsung Spanish-language offering ended up as one of the biggest episodic sensations on the planet.</p><p data-characters=363 data-current-count=673 data-injectable=false>Of course, the fact Money Heist has cracked Netflix’s all-time Top 10 for non-English shows three times over explains the reasons why, but there always comes a point where audiences have had too much.

Maybe, maybe not, but you get the suspicion it’s going to be far from the last offshoot coming down the pipeline.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yvsdOfo6Kwo2LAsbXNZqafnl2pvG6tjKycq6GVqHq1tMCtqmaZnKeyorDYZpmenZ5iv6a5wJ2cZpmemXq4rdKnq2adppq7bq3NZqaroZeeu6K4jK2mZpqVnLavedaiq6Flmah6pLHRrZiippyueqJ5wqGmopuVZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michael-symon-ethnicity-nationality-race-family-body-measurements-career-html.html><span>←</span><span>Michael Symon Ethnicity, Nationality, Race, Family, Body measurements, career</span></a>
