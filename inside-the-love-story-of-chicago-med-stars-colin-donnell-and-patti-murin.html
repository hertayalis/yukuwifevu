The couple was over the moon with joy, but with that joy came another difficult hurdle for the family. At just 10 weeks old, Cecily underwent open heart surgery to repair a congenital defect. Baby Cecily was born with a hole in her heart, a condition called <a href=#>ventricular septal defect</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Murin <a href=#>discussed this</a> at length in an Instagram post, which pictured her daughter in a Halloween costume, dressed as Captain Marvel. The mom wrote, "[Cecily's] a real life, true superhero." The family rallied, and Cecily recovered just fine with her doting parents by her side. It seems these trials and tribulations have only made Donnell and Murin's bond even stronger. In an interview with <a href=#>People</a>, Donnell said, "We've definitely found ways to deal with everything, kind of found our groove in the face of some difficult situations. That I think has been really great for the two of us. It has brought us closer, which is awesome." And despite Cecily being born in the midst of a pandemic, Murin revealed that her daughter came along at just the right time. "Colin and I were able to spend time with her that we would not have normally gotten if the world was 'normal,'" she said to <a href=#>Broadway Direct</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcm1ha31xe8inqqKclWLBqbGMpaavnV2owbC%2B2Gamn2WTnbakrcaoZKadlGLAta3RrGScp5yeu26wzqelnqScYq6vsIypmK2smWK6tr7Ip2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ex-zoey-101-star-alexa-nikolas-calls-for-support-of-super-bowl-protest.html><span>←</span><span>Ex Zoey 101 star Alexa Nikolas calls for support of Super Bowl protest</span></a>
