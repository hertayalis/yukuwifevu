It's currently 75 degrees in LA and around 32 degrees in TDot. As such, I'm already thinking about what to pack. I'll need a good jacket, some gloves, snow-friendly shoes, perhaps a beenie… These are all items I do not wear frequently in LA. I also need to remember to pack my passport and some cash to exchange upon arrival. My point is, for me this is a strange packing situation that will require a little bit of planning and preparation. And speaking of strange packing situations that required a little bit of planning and preparation…</p><p>Yesterday, Federal authorities announced that they had busted a man at JFK for carrying too much cash while traveling. How much cash did he have? Keep in mind the limit is $10,000 USD (or the equivalent in foreign currency). So how much did Mr. Abdulkarim Altareb have on him, and mixed into his luggage? $20,000? $30,000? $50,000? Nope, nope and nope. Try <strong>$770,000</strong> (as you may have deduced from the title of this article).</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-239963 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2017-11-24-at-11.14.00-AM.png alt width=576 height=383 sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-239963 class=wp-caption-text>Photo via Jericho/Wikimedia Commons</p><p>The 48-year-old Yemeni-born man was attempting to fly from JFK to Qatar on March 1st. As part of the standard airport security process, a US Custom Border Patrol officer asked Mr. Altareb to declare how much money he was carrying on his journey. Mr. Altareb put down $6,500 on a form. When he was asked to show agents the money, he ended up pulling out $5,870 in cash.</p><p>He was probably just guesstimating too high, but either way his actions and appearance made the agents suspicious. So the officers began a routine search of Mr. Altareb's bags. Pretty quickly, they started discovering wads of crisp $50 and $100 bills stuffed in a wide variety of drug store items, clothing pockets and shoes.</p><p>The drug store items included boxes of hand soap, Thera-flu, Splenda, Alka-Seltzer and Band-aids.</p><p>According to the criminal complaint that was filed in court yesterday, "Cash was also hidden in soles of shoes, and in the lining of a jacket inside of one of the checked bags."</p><p>When questioned about the money, Mr. Altareb responded: "We are trying to build a building in Yemen. This is my brothers', two brothers' money."</p><p>Altareb was charged with "bulk cash smuggling" and is being held without bail in Brooklyn.</p><p>Obviously, this raises some eyebrows. It's hard not to jump to a salacious conclusion when an Arab man is caught trying to travel to an Arab country with lots of unreported cash. Maybe it's completely, 100% innocent and he really just wants to build a building. I won't stir the controversy any more than necessary…</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxnC5wKdknJmlnLW1edOrsKKml2LBsHnFpbBmnqKkum62xaRksKGknXp4g49pZ2llk5bAqXnHopudnZ5itq95wKWjZqufp8G0ec6fZLCdmaexbrzLmpqeq18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jessica-pabst-dies-in-car-accident.html><span>←</span><span>Jessica Pabst Dies in Car Accident, Memorial Funding , Director of Health Plans at Home State Health</span></a>
