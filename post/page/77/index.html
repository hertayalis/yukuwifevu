On Feb. 23, the Art Newspaper reported, California‚Äôs 4th District Court of Appeals overturned a motion to dismiss a lawsuit by the Committee to Relocate Marilyn (Crema), which is battling to remove Seward Johnson‚Äôs 2011 sculpture ‚ÄúForever Marilyn‚Äù from its current site outside the Palm Springs Art Museum.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Samsung Laptop UEFI Bugs: Not Just for Linux</h2><time>Jun 6, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../samsung-laptop-uefi-bugs-not-just-for-linux.html></a>
About ten days ago I posted about a problem with Samsung laptops getting bricked when trying to boot Linux using UEFI.

Anyone loosely following AMD‚Äôs efforts with ARM intellectual property would have had on their periphery the noise of the A1100 product aimed at servers, codenamed Seattle. The idea was to use AMD‚Äôs back-end expertise to produce a multi-core ARM chip based on eight A57 cores for server and professional embedded systems, supporting up to 128GB of RDIMM memory and two 10GBase-KR Ethernet ports. The secret sauce of the processor is in the co-processors ‚Äì a cryptographic one to offload dedicated acceleration of encryption/decryption or compression/decompression, and a system control co-processor that focuses on security and acts like a ‚Äòprocessor within a processor‚Äô with its own Ethernet connection, RAM, ROM and IO connectivity for remote management and sensing.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Who is Travis Rice Dating Now?
