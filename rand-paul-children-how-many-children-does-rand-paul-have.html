Let’s explore Rand Paul children, career, etc below;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Rand Paul Biography</h2><p>Rand was born in Pittsburgh but grew up in Lake Jackson, Texas, where he attended Brazoswood High School. In 1981, he enrolled at Baylor University.</p><p>He was a regular contributor to the student newspaper “The Baylor Lariat” while studying there.</p><p>He was also a member of the NoZe Brotherhood, a collegiate society at the university. He dropped out of college to pursue his education at Duke University School of Medicine.</p><p>Although Paul was born in Pennsylvania, he would grow up chiefly in Texas. While growing up, Rand Paul was raised in a church-going family; they are Episcopalian by faith.</p><p>In 1988, he received his medical degree, and in 1993, he finished his residency. He went on to work for John Downing of Downing McPeak Vision Centers. He subsequently went to work for the Graves Gilbert Clinic in Bowling Green, where he stayed for 10 years before opening his clinic.</p><p>Paul is a leader who promotes freedom and liberty, and he has even described himself as a libertarian Republican. Although Paul is one of the “cooler heads” in the Senate, he is unafraid to confront his political opponents with facts and data to back his stance.</p><p>Rand Paul’s first ophthalmologist job was with the Downing McPeak Vision Centers. He also worked at the Graves Gilbert Clinic, then he established his own private practice.</p><p>Paul still has an interest in this practice; however, once he was elected to the Senate, he merged his practice with his former employer at Downing. Currently, Paul has medical privileges at two hospitals in Bowling Green.</p><p>In 1991, Rand founded the North Carolina Taxpayers Union. This was in response to President George H.W. Bush’s promise not to raise taxes. He would later establish the Kentucky Taxpayers United.</p><p>In both 2013 and 2014, Rand Paul was recognized by&nbsp;Time Magazine&nbsp;as one of the world’s “100 Most Influential People.”&nbsp;</p><p>Rand has been around politics most of his life. He interned at his father’s Congressional office as a young teenager. He was present when his father headed the Texas delegation during Ronald Reagan’s presidential campaign in 1976.</p><p>Paul’s most recent financial disclosures estimate he has a net worth of $1.5 million.</p><p>Rand Paul has worked as an ophthalmologist prior to his political career. He worked in the offices of other ophthalmologists for just over ten years before he opened his own practice.</p><p>Paul has been a part of the U.S. Senate since 2011. His annual salary as a Senator is $174,000 per year. However, Rand is also a published author, and this is likely where the bulk of his wealth is derived.</p><p>Rand Paul was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Carol and Ron Paul. Ron, his father, is a politician and a doctor.</p><p>His father is a former U.S. Representative from Texas who ran for President three times. Rand was the third child born to his parents, who had five children in total.</p><p>Rand Paul grew up around both medicine and politics, as his father, former presidential candidate and physician Ron Paul was no stranger to either of those areas.</p><p>In 1990, Paul married Kelley Paul. Kelley is a self-employed writer.</p><p>One of Paul’s ears is deaf. He is now a resident of Bowling Green, Kentucky.&nbsp;</p><p>Paul’s wife is also an author and published the book True and Constant Friends: Love and Inspiration from Our Grandmothers, Mothers, and Friends, in 2015.</p><p>In April 2021,&nbsp;Kelley made headlines after she bought stock in Gilead, a company that makes the&nbsp;Covid-19&nbsp;treatment remdesivir.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Rand Paul Children: How many kids does Rand Paul have?</h2><p>Throughout the course of their 30-year-marriage, the couple have welcomed three children together including Duncan, William and Robert.</p><p>While Duncan and Robert have managed to stay out of the spotlight over the years, Paul’s oldest son William made headlines in 2015 after he was&nbsp;cited for a DUI, according to&nbsp;USA Today.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jquYp5xdpa62uIycn6KklKeyr3nHqK5mpZGjxm6vx6KjnaqVo3qlu8SsZKuZnpl6sa3UpWShmaaafA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./invited-happy-hour-lenoir.html><span>←</span><span>Join us!
