A hormonal imbalance&nbsp;</strong></h3><p id=eZUTc6SBnhB data-wc=40>"There can be many reasons why the clock change can make us feel low, both biological and psychological. We think that a lot of the challenging feelings around darker evenings are caused by reduced exposure to sunlight during the day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d4394912e4a2-sad-on-sofa.jpg><p id=e0CKo9gJ-xUH data-wc=52>"A lack of sunlight may cause higher than normal levels of melatonin (the sleep hormone) in a part of our brains called the hypothalamus, making us feel more tired and lethargic. This lack of sunlight might also lower a hormone called serotonin which impacts our appetite and mood, making us feel low.</p><p id=eX6HoR8jSZJe data-wc=17>"Our internal body clock (circadian rhythm), which controls how everything functions and interacts may also be disrupted."</p><p id=eclpCQ_CUUIY data-wc=11><strong>&nbsp;DISCOVER:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Is this the reason we're all so exhausted right now?</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3 dir=ltr><strong>2. Our free time feels shorter</strong></h3><p id=elipaos5gYNx data-wc=14>"Psychologically for most of us, evenings represent time off work and time for ourselves.</p><p id=eWw9jmHe1Dpl data-wc=44>"With evenings getting darker earlier, we find it less easy to go out and do the things we enjoy. We feel like we go to work in the dark and come back in the dark and that is it - no playtime for us.</p><p id=ewybL8_hmvvn data-wc=41>"If you multiply this by a few months, life can feel monotonous. We can also feel like everything is an effort and temptation to ‘just stay in’ is high, but we have to realise that will just make us feel worse."</p><p id=eiGwdCWUTmZn data-wc=13><strong>&nbsp;INSPIRATION: <a class=hm-link href=#>5 ways to make every day special – and feel instantly happier</a></strong></p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>How to feel positive when it's dark</strong></h2><p id=eNQTsI3KGtFj data-wc=36>"You cannot change the seasons and you certainly can’t change the world from turning, so all you are doing by framing winter and autumn as ‘bad’ is wasting precious emotional energy and time," says Dr. Radha.</p><h3 dir=ltr><strong>1 Reframe winter</strong></h3><p id=eRpUrVxZPWpF data-wc=15>Rather than moping about it being dark, Dr. Radha recommends thinking positive thoughts about winter.</p><p id=eEO5-zZNi7aS data-wc=58>"Realise you have the power to change how you think depending on what you focus on. Set yourself a challenge to pick one thing per day you like about winter and focus on that for the whole day in your mind. By the end of the season, you might be surprised by how many things you have identified."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f630f77ab550-resting-outside.jpg><h3 dir=ltr><strong>2. Tune into your senses</strong></h3><p id=eH_Z5sPvWGZq data-wc=31>"Our senses are our friends in the winter months. Our brains have powerful memories and associations with what we smell, hear, touch, taste and see, so use these to feel better.</p><p id=es6ILs_KErvY data-wc=67>"One summery track of music can transport you to that sunny holiday a few years ago. One sniff of a lovely moisturiser can take you on a journey to sunnier and brighter days. One sip of hot chocolate can help you appreciate the cosiness of autumn and reframe winter as not the enemy but as just a different experience. Not ‘good’ or ‘bad’ just as it is.</p><p id=eOL1BwqrM1tU data-wc=19>"Your senses tap into your imagination and your emotions so use them to full effect this autumn and winter."</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Why do I feel happy doing nothing?

Keep in touch with family and friends&nbsp;</strong></h3><p id=euZqIeJsIiLP data-wc=30>"Social connection is one of the mainstays to keeping us well mentally and emotionally. It is too easy in winter to stay in rather than say yes to an invite.</p><p id=ep7A3pUf25nS data-wc=34>"Our relationships are one of the major predictors of us feeling good mentally. Make sure you plan dedicated time, either as a regular thing or in advance with friends or family every single week.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7bcfc3d736ff-happy-sober-friends.jpg><p id=egZMeUTk8fgE data-wc=30>"It can be helpful to book an activity together or to do something so that it feels more engaged and involved rather than a dinner which you can easily cancel."</p><p id=eEXWBqNTn8gM data-wc=3><strong>4. Stay active&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eDjakiNAcaGp data-wc=20>"It is tempting to hibernate and avoid exercise because we feel just too tired, but actually exercise gives us energy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e21e91e61e98-exercise-in-winter.jpg><p id=e_Cr0N5mDkMg data-wc=52>"Adapt your exercise routine to include group classes to motivate yourself to do something and to get a social element out of it too. Or adapt your active time to the middle of the day so you benefit from natural daylight which can in itself help us with feeling low during winter.</p><p id=edtUrcpJuRfX data-wc=22>"Getting active boosts your mood and makes you have more energy, confidence and builds self-esteem so however tempting, don’t give it up.</p><p id=e6ZLdfNs_1OH data-wc=12><strong>&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Find more inspiration on how to be happier on HELLO!'s Happines Hub</a></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
