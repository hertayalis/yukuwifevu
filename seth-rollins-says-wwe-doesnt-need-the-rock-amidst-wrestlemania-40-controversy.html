However, The Rock vs Roman Reigns is now the biggest match for the event and Rollins decided to take a shot at The Rock in light of this.</p><p>The Rock’s role as a part of&nbsp;<a href=#>TKO’s Board of Directors also grants him influence over his choices</a>. This came into play for SmackDown last week, as&nbsp;<a href=#>Cody Rhodes stepped aside to give his WrestleMania 40 spot to The Rock</a>.</p><p>Fans have been rallying for&nbsp;The Rock to give Cody Rhodes his WrestleMania 40 spot back as well, but nothing will change that. This birthed the ‘We Want Cody’ movement but to no avail.</p><p>While speaking on <a href=#>Good Morning Football</a>, Seth Rollins addressed The Rock’s potential involvement in Wrestlemania, Rollins emphasized WWE’s current success, mentioning sold-out arenas, stadium events, and lucrative television deals with USA Network and Netflix.</p><p>”Hey look man, if The Rock wants to jump on the bandwagon, ride my coattails into Wrestlemania, that’s fine with me. Look I did it, WWE is the hottest it’s ever been. We are selling out arenas, stadiums. We got two massive deals, SmackDown the USA Network and RAW signed the most lucrative television deal in the history of pro wrestling with Netflix. We are living life right now, we are huge.”</p><p>Acknowledging The Rock’s contributions to the industry, Rollins expressed respect for him but playfully mentioned that The Rock is riding his coattails. Rollins asserted his significant run on RAW over the last decade, claiming credit for the show’s success during that period. He concluded by stating WWE doesn’t necessarily need The Rock but would love to have him.</p><p>”For The Rock to want to come on board now, jump on my WrestleMania, get his toes wet, I get it. So mad respect to him for he’s done for our industry, so I got no problem with The Rock jumping on and doing his business for us. Like I said, he’s riding my coattails, you need to remember that.”</p><p>‘‘Who’s been on RAW for the last 10 years more than anybody? It’s me, this guy. I get the credit, not him. So he can come in, he can get what he wants. He can take his little piece and go back to Hollywood to do his thing. We don’t need ya…we’d love to have ya… but we don’t need ya, big guy.”</p><p>WWE also went the&nbsp;<a href=#>extra mile to keep The Rock’s plans under wraps</a>. We’ll have to see how WWE will go forward with The Rock and Roman Reigns’ feud in the coming weeks.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>What do you think of what Seth Rollins had to say?
