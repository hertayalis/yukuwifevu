And they won't be alone, as a whole batch of EA Sports titles are coming to the service for a limited time.</p><p>Whether you prefer racing, football, soccer, hockey, golf, or <a href=#>baseball</a>, this weekend will be the best time to try out one the top games for each sport. Let's take a look at everything coming to Xbox Game Pass from EA Sports and exactly how long they'll stay free to play.</p><h2 id=mcetoc_1hjsu0i492>NHL 24, Madden 24, and more hit Xbox Game Pass</h2><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/YD1ulDaVoPhhibwkdlSy56PTAPBCda3iKXqy10xI0m4/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMy82NTI5YWI3OTk5YWE0LU5ITCAyNCAyMDIzLTEwLTA0IDE3LTM3LTAxLnBuZw alt="NHL 24 2023-10-04 17-37-01" width=100% height=auto style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Half a dozen titles from EA Sports have all arrived at once as part of the publisher taking over <a href=#>Free Play Days on Xbox Game Pass</a>. For football and hockey fans, that means all eyes point to <a href=#>Madden 24</a> and NHL 24. While the former had some hiccups this year, it remains the best football simulation game around. <a href=#>NHL 24</a> looked better than ever this year, and gameplay improvements were significant.</p><p>For soccer fans (or real football fans, depending on where you're reading this from), <a href=#>EA Sports FC 24</a> is also available all weekend on Xbox regardless of whether you're a Game Pass subscriber. It normally takes all three of these annual releases about six months to become available as part of the standard Xbox Game Pass and EA Play libraries, and that's still a month or two out on those games.&nbsp;</p><p>For racing fans, they've added F1 23 and <a href=#>EA Sports WRC</a>. The former is great for fans who want that traditional Formula One style, but anyone looking for something more rugged should try the latter from the team behind the DiRT Rally series. EA Sports PGA Tour is there for golf fans, and lastly there's Super Mega Baseball 4 which isn't leaving and will remain a part of the Game Pass library moving forward.</p><h2 id=mcetoc_1hjsu0i493>When does EA Sports Xbox Game Pass Free Play Days end?</h2><p>Unfortunately, the free fun won't last forever. The EA Sports takeover of <strong>Free Play Days began on Thursday, January 11, 2024 at 12:01am PT</strong>. During that time, all of the games mentioned above will be free to play for Xbox Game Pass Core and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers.</p><p>If you don't have an Xbox Game Pass subscription, you can still try EA Sports FC 24 during Free Play Days. This limited period is <strong>due to end on Sunday, January 14, 2024 at 11:59pm PT</strong>.</p><p>3 days, 12:44:40</p><p>You can utilize the countdown clock above to see how much time is left to try things out. When things do wrap up, the only game which will remain available to Xbox Game Pass subscribers is Super Mega Baseball 4. While it could be removed at a later date, it was <a href=#>already announced as part of the January lineup on Game Pass</a>.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/6JfyMxzqefEw2V8wMma28KOJ8jSaCDpCYwhJl_odjS0/rs:fill:180:180:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9JTUdfNDEyMy5wbmc alt="patches chance" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXNsWWtrl%2Bau3C5wJ2bnqZdZ4FwuselZGtsXZu%2FprGMoJimnV2lrrS%2F</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-shameless-and-star-wars-jedi-star-cameron-monaghan-gay.html><span>←</span><span>Is Shameless and Star Wars Jedi star Cameron Monaghan gay?</span></a>
