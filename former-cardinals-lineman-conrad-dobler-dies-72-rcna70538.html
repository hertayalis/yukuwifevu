Dobler also embraced his troublemaking persona in a 1987 Miller Lite commercial by riling up by getting them to argue the beer’s “Tastes great/Less filling” tag line.</p><p>“Our hearts go out to the family, friends and former teammates of Conrad Dobler,” Cardinals owner Michael Bidwill said in a statement. “He was the kind of tough, physical and fierce player that you love to line up with as a teammate and hate to line up against as an opponent. On the field, Conrad was a big reason for the success of the Cardiac Cards of the 1970s. Away from it, he brought authentic joy and caring to everyone who had the privilege of being his friend and that is what I will remember most.”</p><p>Dobler earned three consecutive Pro Bowl appearances from 1975-77 while playing under Hall of Fame coach Don Coryell. The 1975 offensive set what was then an NFL record by allowing eight sacks. He played for the Cardinals from 1972-77 before moving on to play two seasons each with New Orleans and Buffalo.</p><p class=endmark>Dobler was a fifth-round pick out of Wyoming in the 1972 NFL draft. He is survived by six children and 12 grandchildren.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r67Cp5ywq16YvK57zZ6urGelqHqvsdasZp%2BnoqKys3nCmqmdoZ6WubR5y6KlnqWRo3qku82rmJ1llKSvrbHRZpuinaNihHN50Zylmm9gaoB5</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./betty-aberlin-net-worth-70786.html><span>←</span><span>Betty Aberlin Net Worth</span></a>
