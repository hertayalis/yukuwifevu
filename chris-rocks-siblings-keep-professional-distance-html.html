When they both were taking baby steps in their career, brother Rock was a talked-about American celebrity and was known worldwide.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Arguably one of the most incredible stand-up acts of all time, Rock is often described as someone who provided space and time to his brothers so that they could make a name for themselves in entertainment.

He dropped out of high school and began performing at gigs courtesy of his brother Tony who would ask sibling Jordan to open for him during his shows in New York.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Jordan recalled how Tony initially&nbsp;refused to take him on the road but at the same time filled him with helpful trade tips.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Relatively successful performer Tony is known to be a helping hand to his aspiring brother.
