Instead, you’ll receive fresh in-season blooms three times a year (summer, spring and fall), just type in your zip-code and select how much sunlight level you’d like. Each plant will be in their optimal growing stage to make caring for it simple and easy. All the instructions will be provided, all you have to do is pot it and watch as it flourishes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/mygardenbox.jpg><p>Consider this your sign to turn your home and outdoor space into a live-in greenhouse. With this plant box subscription, you’ll have the choice of a one month, three month, six month or 12 month plan, which will include either an indoor or outdoor plant and everything you could need to help it thrive. Each plant will be accompanied with care instructions, a cute hand painted pot, pre-portioned ingredients and fun facts about the particular breed you’ve been sent.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/houseplantbox.jpg><p>Whether you want beginner-friendly options or pet-safe picks, this subscription service will provide you with not one but two plants. Choose between a monthly, three month, six month or 12 month plan, which will include detailed care instructions and a plastic nursery planter with soil. No matter what plan you go with, the brand ensures you won’t receive a duplicate plant over the year, but your home will probably turn into a jungle — but in the best way possible.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-04-12-at-1.09.06-PM.png><p>Add paper towels, pasta, cleaning products… and plants to your cart?
