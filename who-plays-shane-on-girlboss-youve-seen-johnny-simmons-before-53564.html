You've Seen Johnny Simmons Before</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>If you are one of the many people who spent the weekend marathoning Girlboss, you probably also spent that time switching between screens. When you weren't glued to the Netflix series on your laptop, tablet, or TV (yes, some people still watch television sets), you were likely using a secondary device to look up facts about the real life Sophia Amoruso and the actors on the show. But, if you forgot to look up the actor who plays Shane because you fell down a Wikipedia rabbit hole or got distracted by Instagram, I've got your back. So, <a href=# class=T3D>who plays Shane on </a><a href=# class=T3D>Girlboss</a>?</p><p>The Netflix series loosely based on Nasty Gal founder Sophia Amoruso's autobiography features a hunky love interest for the TV portrayal of Sophia: Shane, played by Johnny Simmons. Though both Shane and Amoruso's real ex-husband <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Joel Jerek Degraff</a> are musicians, Amoruso told Bustle that all of <a href=# class=T3D>the characters are inventions for the show</a> — aside from Sophia. So, since there's no real person Shane is based on, let's get to know the actor behind the man instead. Here are 10 places you have seen the actor Johnny Simmons before — and, trust me, you have seen him before.</p><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">1</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">'Evan Almighty'</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"></figure><p>Simmons played Evan Baxter's (Steve Carell) son in the 2007 film.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">2</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">'Hotel For Dogs'</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"></figure><p>Maybe it wasn't his most ... eh dignified role, but Simmons played Dave in the 2009 family comedy.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">3</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">'Jennifer's Body'</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"></figure><p>He was Chip in Jennifer's Body.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">4</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">'Scott Pilgrim Vs.
