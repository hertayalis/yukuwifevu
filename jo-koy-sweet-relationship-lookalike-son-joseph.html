"I love being a dad," he said on Father's Day last year. On his son's 18th birthday, the comedian took to Instagram to pay homage to their close bond saying, "I’ve always said that my life didn’t start until you were born. Now I’m excited to see what your future holds. The world is yours my son and I’ll be right next to you the whole way."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/41538a8a86d1-jo-koy-son-joseph.jpg><p id=ec9LdK5HkTw data-wc=70>The natural inclination towards public displays of affection is clearly something Joseph has inherited from his father. In 2020 he took to Instagram himself to share a touching black and white photo of the pair of them standing on stage in the full arena during one of Jo's shows. The post was captioned: "Still can’t believe this happened. So proud and so happy u lived out one of ur dreams."</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=ehU0syi8p9 data-wc=60>But that doesn't mean that Joseph is exempt from being worked into his dad's stand-up material. Jo said on the Larry King Show in 2019: "My son is just a walking joke for me. If it happens inside these walls that I pay for, I'm going to capitalize, and you’re going to enjoy what we make off of you together."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c3dd6e3ae51e-jo-koy-son-child.jpg><p id=eOWWFU3yjHE data-wc=33>However, he is sensitive to Joseph's feelings and reassured The Aspen Times that "if he doesn’t want me to talk about it, I won’t. But for the most part, he’s cool with it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b91e2a6689b8-jo-koy-son-comedy.jpg><p id=ec2bO-y2mt data-wc=77>The comedian has previously opened up about co-parenting with his ex-partner and the healthy relationship they have maintained to raise Joseph. Chatting to <a class=hm-link href=#>Kelly Clarkson</a> on her eponymous talk show he said: "We're a loving family and we can work. Just because you’re not married, it doesn't mean you can't be the best of friends. You still have the responsibility to raise this beautiful child together. And it's fun to see my son see his parents happy."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8fb6b74bc16e-jo-koy-son-vacation.jpg><p id=eM4L0auczek data-wc=97>Jo has opened up about the likeness between himself and his son, and it's not just in their looks. It appears the 20-year-old has a sense of humour like his father. During an appearance on River City Live, Jo said of Joseph: "I know he's got a creative mind and he's got a sense for fashion and comedy, and I know that’s the avenue and lane he's going to take after school. So I will be there to help him but in no way am I going to force him or discourage him not to do anything."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7f87c67aaff3-jo-koy-son-childhood.jpg><p id=eu6KhKODEF data-wc=75>Joseph worked in the crew for Jo's 2023 world tour and has even made a TV appearance alongside his dad. In 2022 the pair were seen twice on ABC’s Celebrity Family Feud. Speaking to the show's host Steve Harvey, Jo said: "He's so talented! He's so funny, Steve! And I'm just so honored to be on the road and share these memories with him ‘cause he works with me and he rides with me everywhere."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2430cad3637e-jo-koy-son-tour.jpg><p id=eXCuii-wI7 data-wc=39>The duo have also taken to the red carpet together.
