You can keep it, but it won’t look as good on you as it does on me.”</p><p>Jasmine continued to read the letter: “Here are my panties that he took off that night. The rest you can keep for your imagination.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Next, Jasmine emptied a pair of black underwear out of the envelope that she claimed was left at her and Gino’s front door along with the letter.</p><p>Gino was the first to call her out, claiming that a random fan of the show left the letter and the underwear on his porch and denied spending any time with a woman besides Jasmine.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-90-day-fiance-viewers-don-t-believe-jasmine-s-claims-and-think-production-helped-her-facilitate-it>90 Day Fiance viewers don’t believe Jasmine’s claims and think production helped her facilitate it</h2><p>The scene was shocking to the rest of the cast of 90 Day Fiance, as well as viewers at home, but not everyone was buying Jasmine’s story.</p><p>Taking to X (formerly Twitter), 90 Day Fiance fans accused Jasmine of manufacturing the whole thing and felt that production might have aided her.</p><p>One viewer uploaded a gif of Kermit the Frog speedily clicking away at a typewriter, insinuating that Jasmine wrote the letter herself.</p><p>They captioned it, “Jasmine furiously writing that note in the bathroom to pretend like she’s not ten pounds of crazy in a five pound bag.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Another viewer, @90DayCray1, felt as though Jasmine’s BFF, Nikki Exotika, was responsible for drafting the letter.</p><p>“Jasmine coming out with yeast infection panties and a letter Nikki made for her,” they wrote. “Can we be done with this?”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>“This fake a** letter and dirty panty is absolutely not it, TLC do better ain’t nobody doing all that for Gino,” read @NinaKaprisun’s post along with a gif asking the network to “Cut the cap.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Yet another X user accused production of being involved in the lip gloss fiasco.</p><p>“TLC CMON this is SO STAGED. Jasmine with the fake letter COMPLETELY confirms that the lipgloss was a producer plant,” their post read.</p><p>“This completely gave it away … that was so cheap.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jasmine-maintains-the-lip-gloss-wasn-t-hers-and-wasn-t-planted-by-production>Jasmine maintains the lip gloss wasn’t hers and wasn’t planted by production</h2><p>As Monsters and Critics previously reported, Jasmine has stood her ground, insisting that the lip gloss isn’t hers and belongs to another woman who was in Gino’s car without her knowledge.</p><p>According to Jasmine, she has “<a href=#>evidence and reports</a>” that Gino was culpable, and many of her Instagram followers agreed that Gino was guilty as charged.</p><p>Jasmine also insisted that the lip gloss was not planted by producers, <a href=#>telling ExtraTV</a>, “It was not planned by any producer. I know my producer, and I talked to her… and she was as in shock as I was.”</p><p>Season 8 of 90 Day Fiance: Happily Ever After? premieres on Sunday, March 17, at 8/7c on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ2lleqWt2GadopmemLJuwMSlo2aZnKF6t7XEsJyrq12Yrq24jKisrWWalsCutc2eqmaekaCybrjEraueql2Wu6V506Ggp6Ndpb%2BwsNScq6KnnmK1prjPnptmq6SWtKZ5yK1m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=next href=./anna-heinrich-html.html><span>Anna Heinrich - Age, Family, Bio</span><span>→</span></a></nav></article></main><footer class=footer><p>&copy; 2024 <a href=./></a></p><p>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/ rel=noopener target=_blank>Hugo️️</a>️</p></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
