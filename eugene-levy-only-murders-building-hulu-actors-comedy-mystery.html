They start their own called Only Murders in the Building after a murder in their building. Each season they use their amateur sleuthing skills and podcast to solve a new murder that happened at the end of the previous season (except season 1 of course.)</p><p>OMG it's so addictively good.</p><p>The succession of celebrity guest stars&nbsp;from cameos&nbsp;to full-on roles has been incredible. Sting, Meryl Streep, Paul Rudd. Matthew Broderick, Nathan Lane, Jane Lynch, Molly Shannon, Tina Fey, Amy Schumer, Mel Brooks, Jimmy Fallon, and Eva Longoria to name just a few.</p><p>And now award-winning producer and actor of&nbsp;Schitts Creek, Eugene Levy,&nbsp;whose own roster of comedies is joining the cast for season 4 to solve the murder of one of the celebrity guest stars. Of course, I was so bummed at who was murdered at the end of season 3 but I won't give it away.</p><p>According to the <a href=#>Hollywood Reporter</a>, we know Meryl Streep's character and Molly Shannon's character will be returning and I believe Eva Longoria, too.</p><p>No word on when filming will start for Season 4. By the way,&nbsp;Steve Martin came up with the idea for&nbsp;<i>Only Murders in the Building</i>&nbsp;in 2011.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Photos of Young Selena Gomez at Start of Career</h2><p>Look back on these fresh-faced pictures of Selena Gomez at the start of her career in the mid-to-late 2000s.</p><p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Albums That Took Over a Decade to Come Out</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6Wws8HSoWWcp51ksrazxKecZqSVq8Zuu82lsGalpaexpr7SZpmuoZyZtq%2BzjKGspa1dlrC1u9GsZJynnZqxunnMsqqtnaKufA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-do-hydraulic-lifters-collapse-html.html><span>←</span><span>Why do hydraulic lifters collapse?</span></a>
