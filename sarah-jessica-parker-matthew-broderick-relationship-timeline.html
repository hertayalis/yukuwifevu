Keep scrolling to find out everything you need to know about Sarah and Matthew's relationship…</p><h2 dir=ltr>How did Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick meet?</h2><p id=edkHVJ6yacG data-wc=61>Who said love at first sight was just the stuff of fairytales? According to a heartfelt interview with Andy Cohen on Watch What Happens Live&nbsp;in 2022, actor Matthew revealed he knew the moment he set eyes on Sarah that she was the one. "The first time I met her. I saw her walking down the street, and thought, 'That's it.'"&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">Don't miss</h4><p id=e11G8Po5SfX data-wc=33><a class=hm-link href=#>The loved-up duo</a> met in 1991 through Sarah's brothers Pippin and Toby, who were friends with The Lion King&nbsp;actor after he directed a play at their theatre company, Naked Angels Theatre Company.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2408258ebe4c-gettyimages-1407122488.jpg><p id=eWw4Ka2oMMA data-wc=67>SJP had just split with her former beau and Sherlock Holmes star, Robert, so it took a few months, but eventually, the now-couple went out to the movies together. Matthew explained in an interview with <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The New York Times&nbsp;in 1996</a>: "My memory is that literally months passed when I didn't ask her for a date," to which SJP replied, "Your memory is correct."</p><p id=eRj7jtisJqi data-wc=28>She added: "He left a very charming, very self-effacing message on the machine," she recalled. "You know, 'Hi, it's Matthew Broderick.' You had to use your last name."</p><h2 dir=ltr>When did Sarah and Matthew get married?</h2><p id=ehCmFoPR2xg data-wc=46><a class=hm-link href=#>Sarah and Matthew</a> went on to tie the knot on 19 May 1997, one year before Sex in the City&nbsp;graced our screens. The happy couple opted for a subtle affair and bamboozled guests with their invitations, which you can see below on the second slide.&nbsp;</p><p id=eFkN2nDSNXa data-wc=60>Rather than revealing the occasion was to mark their nuptials, Sarah and Michael pretended their get-together (of around 100 people), was simply a party. The actress, who is also <a class=hm-link href=#>famed for her incredible sense of style</a>, didn't even wear a traditional ivory wedding gown and instead opted for a waist-cinching black dress - but of course, she still looked flawless.</p><p id=e-S5L4Itnhj data-wc=26>Matthew's mom Patrica made a hilarious quip to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>People</a> magazine about the laid-back affair, jesting: "They're not the Kennedys," a fun call-back to Sarah's former beau.</p><p id=e1m024TwO2G data-wc=67>Sarah also opened up to the publication about her big day. "I never thought about a wedding dress. Never," she said. "[I] had not one daydream about it. At one point I just simply remember thinking, 'God, I really hope he asks me to marry him.' I don't know when or why. It was fairly early on." The couple celebrated their 26th Wedding Anniversary in May 2023.</p><h2 dir=ltr>Do Sarah and Matthew have children?</h2><p id=e0j8n-tmUHp data-wc=41>The husband-and-wife duo are doting parents to three children, James Wilkie, 20, and twin daughters Tabitha Hodge and Marion Loretta Elwell, 13. They welcomed their firstborn James on 28 October 2002, and affectionately named him after his late grandfather, James Broderick.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e7aad85dcd27-sarah-jessica-parker-twins-family-d.jpg><p id=eTyhuoR-HrN6 data-wc=23>Nearly seven years later, on 22 June 2009, their family was complete with the addition of two beautiful twin girls, Tabitha and Marion.&nbsp;</p><p id=eMz4J6Xtr9 data-wc=59>While doing promotional interviews for the second series of the Sex and the City spin-off <a class=hm-link href=#>And Just Like That...</a>, Sarah opened up about <a class=hm-link href=#>the family's home life.</a> "We cook every night, it's a source of huge amount of pride for everybody, but it's also mystifying because we just don't order in as a family," she said.</p><p id=excSKS0HXFl data-wc=59>​"And on the rare occasion we have… we always hear [of] other families, they do it and then one kid orders from this place and one kid [from another]," she continued. "It's so confusing… But we really do cook 5 to 6 nights a week for sure. We try to always have a Sunday dinner – we invite people."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8dYWUa29xZ6OWv6K0jKOcrKuZmK5uvMCrop6qXaKutcDHnq5mmqKksaa%2ByJyiZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoGLBqrnEpaCnnV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./moose-attacks-iditarod-rookie-bridgett-watkins-sled-team-injures-4-dogs.html><span>←</span><span>Moose attacks Iditarod rookie Bridgett Watkins sled team, injures 4 dogs</span></a>
