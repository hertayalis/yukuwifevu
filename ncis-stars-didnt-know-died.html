His final onscreen appearance would be the posthumously released 2023 movie "Outlaw Johnny Black."</p><p>In 2021, Freeman died at the age of 41. "A brilliant human being with an intense and soulful spirit, he leaves us with an indelible imprint in our hearts," Freeman's manager, Joe S. Montifiore, said in a statement released to <a href=#>CNN</a>. "His life was filled with deep loyalty, affection, and generosity towards his family and friends, and an extraordinary zest for life.&nbsp;He was extremely proud of his recent film work and was very excited for the next chapter of his career."</p><p>A few months later, <a href=#>TMZ</a> revealed Freeman's death was the result of an accidental overdose, caused by a toxic combination of liquor and drugs, including alprazolam, cocaine,&nbsp;fentanyl, hydrocodone, and oxycodone.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxma4F4f46nmqKrXajBor7SZpuinJ6peqy6zrBknaGVmXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./robert-ryan-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Robert Ryan Net Worth 2024</span></a>
