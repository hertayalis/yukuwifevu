For those who need a refresher, the series follows protagonist Asta, a boy born without magical powers in a world where magic is the norm. Despite this, he vows to become the Wizard King after he’s gifted with a Grimoire that grants him anti-magic powers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6mmKefkWSvra3CpGScpJ%2BrsrN5wqGYqayVp3p0gphmqZ6klZbApnnDmqueZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./regina-king-ian-alexander-jr-grieving-mothers-interview.html><span>←</span><span>&amp;quot;No One Could Have Prepared Me for This&amp;quot;</span></a>
