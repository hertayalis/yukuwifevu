Penn's jealousy issues reportedly got so bad that he thought Madonna cheated on him with singer Nick Kamen, <a href=# one-link-mark=yes>People</a> reported. The "Like A Virgin" singer denied any accusations of infidelity and filed for divorce from Penn for the second time in 1989, per <a href=#>The New York Times</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>Their divorce was made nastier with accusations of domestic abuse, which Madonna denied and defended Penn against (via <a href=# one-link-mark=yes>Marie Claire</a>).
