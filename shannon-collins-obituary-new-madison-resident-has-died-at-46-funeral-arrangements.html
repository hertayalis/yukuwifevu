Born on February 22, 1977, in York, Pennsylvania, to Jim and Karen Chronister, Shannon’s vibrant spirit and joyful demeanor touched the lives of many. Shannon is survived by her devoted husband of 28 years, Anthony Collins, and their three children, Aiden, Xander, and Liam Collins. She leaves behind a legacy of love, laughter, and genuine compassion.</p><p>Shannon’s earlier years were dedicated to youth ministry, where she served with Child Evangelism Fellowship in Durham, North Carolina. Her impact was profound, and she formed lasting friendships while positively influencing the lives of many. Known for her ability to fit a remarkable number of teenagers into a single vehicle, Shannon’s commitment to youth ministry showcased her boundless energy and passion for making a difference.</p><p>Later, she served as a Youth Pastor at Cedar Grove Church, imparting valuable life lessons on strength, resilience, and the importance of serving and loving others genuinely.
