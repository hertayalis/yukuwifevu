You can go into the studio and not even be a musician, start beating on stuff, and they can take parts out of it, move it around, and then you can sound like Slash. If you want some weird feedback effect in the middle of a guitar solo.”&nbsp;<strong>– Mick Mars&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“It was bothering me a lot, and I became addicted to pain medication, which is like what dragged me down. When we first started talking about this thing, I was pretty much out of it, but I wanted to do it. So I needed to get myself overhauled, cleaned up, and everything else to do this because I wanted to do it, you know?”&nbsp;<strong>– MickMars&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“When I drank, I had a very different attitude towards my playing. It was sloppier, but I liked it that way. It was like the alcohol was telling my mind what to do.”&nbsp;<strong>– MickMars&nbsp;</strong></p><h3>You may also read: <a href=# rel=bookmark>Tobias Forge net worth</a></h3><p>“And it is not really clubs. And it is theaters that we are doing, but, yes, they will be doing that for the six weeks and the local band. There will be a local “Battle of the Bands” winner that will be opening as well. That opens up another door for the bands that might be good but don’t have the money to go to New York to be heard or to LA to be heard.”&nbsp;<strong>– MickMars&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“A couple of reasons. “Decade of Decadence” wasn’t really the greatest hit. It was more of an album that had the band look back over the first ten years of being together and let us pick our favorite songs from those albums. “Greatest Hits” is more of what were hits for us.”&nbsp;<strong>– MickMars&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“That sounds like an old hippy thing, but it is not so restricted. Unlike Elektra Records, we are going to push it and put it out without dropping the ball. Elektra dropped the ball so many times on our records after “Dr. Feelgood” it was just embarrassing and a little disheartening.”&nbsp;<strong>– MickMars&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>3 Life Lessons from Mick Mars</h2><p>After learning everything there is to know about Mick Mars’ net worth and his path to success, let’s look at some of the things we can all learn from him.</p><h3>1.
