Her mother, Ann, gave birth to Priscilla when she was 19 years old, and her father, James (a Navy pilot), perished in an aircraft crash when she was just 6 months old. In 1948, Ann married Air Force officer Paul Beaulieu, and Priscilla began using his surname instead of Wagner’s. Because of Beaulieu’s Air Force job, the family relocated every few years, thus Presley grew up in Connecticut, New Mexico, Maine, and Texas. In 1956, Paul was deployed to Germany, where Priscilla met Elvis Presley, who was serving in the Army at the time.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How much does Priscilla Presley make per year?</h2><p>The renowned Author earns an estimated salary of $5 Million per Year.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What investments does Priscilla Presley have?</h2><p>The famous Author does not have any other investment known to the public aside from her authoring.
