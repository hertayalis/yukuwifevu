<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Razer BlackWidow Ultimate Mechanical Gaming Keyboard Review</h1></header><section class=post-content><br><h2>Introduction and Packaging</h2><p>Several months ago, we had a quick look at the <a href=#>BlackWidow Ultimate</a> from Razer, a company very well known for their focus on gaming-related products. A few weeks ago, Razer announced that they have developed their own all-new mechanical switches, upgrading most of their keyboards with them in the process. The upgrade involves the BlackWidow Ultimate keyboard, and we have the new "2014" version that we'll be reviewing today. Razer has made plenty of noise about their new switches, and while we'll have more to say on that in a moment, let's start as usual with a look at the packaging and included items.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/7911/RZBWU_01_575px.JPG width=275 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a> &nbsp; <a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/7911/RZBWU_02_575px.JPG width=275 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>We received the BlackWidow Ultimate in a nicely designed cardboard box, with a small opening allowing you to test the keys. We especially liked that idea and we wholeheartedly recommend, given that it is possible, that you should visit a retail store and test the switches yourself before purchasing a keyboard. No amount of text can fully describe the feel of a mechanical switch, especially if you have no previous experience with any mechanical keyboard.</p><p>The bundle is well presented but minimal; there is a nice envelope with a quick start guide, warranty information and product registration cards, as well as two large stickers, but that is about it. There is not even a disk with the keyboard's software; an internet connection is required to download it.</p><h2>Software</h2><p>The Razer Synapse software is, in our opinion, where Razer should have focused their marketing attention. With it, several profiles can be programmed into the BlackWidow Ultimate and the user can switch between them on the fly. It is also possible to link a program to each profile, a very handy feature if you want to link each profile to a specific game or application. It would be even better if the software would reset to the previous profile once the game/application has been closed though.</p><p>Aside from the programming of macros, the software allows every single key of the keyboard to be reprogrammed, a feature that can be highly useful. You can easily change the functions of any key -- and not just reprogram it to perform a single keystroke; the keys can be reprogrammed to execute macros, perform multimedia functions, launch applications and more. The combinations are practically infinite and this feature can be extremely useful, especially in games that do not allow the remapping of certain keys.</p><p>Furthermore, the backlight brightness can be adjusted and linked to certain profiles It can also be set to pulsate, which we do not recommend, as the brightness will essentially blind you every several seconds. When online, the Razer Synapse even allows the user to save the profiles to a free online account and import them into other Razer keyboards.</p><p>In short, the Synapse software has plenty of good features, and it's one of the highlights of the BlackWidow.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIR6fZBoqZqylad6o7jAnKKwoZSkxG7By62gppmkmnquscKhmKehk5a5brPApqCnn12gsrquzpqpnWWimsOqsdY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-work-at-nike.html><span>←</span><span>How old do you have to be to work at Nike?</span></a>
