The latest development in the on-going legal battle, in case you were wondering, is that Sonya Miller has reportedly been kicked out of P's Calabasas home, where she&nbsp;was living with their seven children.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In new legal documents, Sonya claims that P had security guards preventing her from entering the gated community where they reside. The No Limit rapper pays the rent on the house, however Sonya says he's threatened to stop paying. She also states that he cut off her cable and her phone. Master P isn't done yet though, Sonya adds that he also told her he would&nbsp;repossess her SUV, which, she says, would force her and their children to walk everywhere and would likely aggravate her hernia and vertigo.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Thus, Sonya is demanding that her estranged husband start forking over some money, while they continue to settle the divorce.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Master P has quickly responded to these allegations, though. P explains his issue is not with Sonya living in the Calabasas home, but with her allowing her boyfriend and friends to infiltrate the home.&nbsp;"But I’m not going to allow access to her boyfriend and partying friends to come over and sleep where my kids are," he says. "She doesn’t even take my kids to school and my sixteen year old failed all of her classes last year under her mother’s lack of guidance."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">He says that her court filing is a publicity stunt, and that he'll be able to prove in court that his soon-to-be-ex wife has been throwing party after party at their home, and neglecting their children.&nbsp;"These records will be furnished to the courts to show the heavy traffic and penalties that I have had to pay for all the crazy parties she’s been having," he says.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Master P promises he'll take care of his family, he just wants Sonya to get her act together.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>&lt;b>Editor-in-Chief&lt;/b> &lt;!--BR--> Rose Lilah updates HNHH daily, while also managing the other writers on-staff and all HNHH contributors.
