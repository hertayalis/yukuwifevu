But I am not a small boy at all. I am the eldest of 7 children”, he said.</p><p>When asked why he bears a northern name, Don Little confirmed that he is from the northern region, Bolgatanga to be precise, however, he has not been there before.</p><p>“My mother is an Ashanti and my father is a northerner from Bolgatanga. But I have not been there before. If you tell me you want to sponsor me so I send you there right now I will not be able to do that. My father is dead now. But I have 6 other siblings from the same mother and father”, Don Little said.</p><p>According to Don Little, what makes him happy is when he is sad and gets a lady around to advise him or speak with him.</p><p>The actor revealed that despite the many men or guys that have helped him, the support he has had from ladies outweighs that of the guys.</p><p>“When I am sad I have a lady around. It motivates me a lot. One thing I love and respect about ladies os they have sympathy. Where I have reached right now, I can say 90 percent is from ladies. Even though guys have also helped me, the ladies are more”, he said.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Karim Abdul (@nanaromeowelewele)</a></p><ul class=td-pulldown-filter-list></ul><a class="td-social-sharing-button td-social-handler td-social-expand-tabs" href=# data-block-uid=tdi_37 title=More><i class="td-icon-plus td-social-expand-tabs-icon"></i></a> <span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span> <span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTBmqqeZpOkunC52GanmqqVo8G0ecearZ5lZ2KwqbXLnamepl2Wu6V5yGaYpmWknbJuscudnKysXZm8r3nLoqutpJVis6q6wKWjsmWimsOmrcusZKGho2KuqLGO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lemony-white-wine-capellini.html><span>←</span><span>Lemony White Wine Capellini</span></a>
