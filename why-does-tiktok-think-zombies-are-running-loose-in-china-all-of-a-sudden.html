The article, titled “This is how a zombie apocalypse is most likely to start in China” theorized that due to China being a “communist state”, it would be ground zero for brain-eaters.</p><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=352 data-injectable=false>It must be noted that China’s official governmental system is hard to pin down, with accusations of their system leaning more heavily into capitalist ideas than communist, with accusations as well of the Chinese Communist Party abandoning Marxism from some leftists. The ruling party should be distinguished from the official governmental system.</p><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=653 data-injectable=true>The article’s author states that the make-up of its government would suggest they’d cover up and suppress information around such a hypothetical outbreak, and cites a Chinese culture of “saving face”, which they believe would lead the government to then producing the vaccine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-42.png><p data-characters=156 data-current-count=456 data-injectable=true></p><p>The article ends with an editor’s note declaring it an opinion piece, and also features quotes from the book World War Z to support their opinion.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Why is it trending on TikTok?</h2><p data-characters=205 data-current-count=205 data-injectable=false>The aforementioned opinion piece later saw a segment of it translated into different languages on TikTok, causing the fear and panic that an outbreak had just begun in the most populated country on Earth.</p><p data-characters=289 data-current-count=494 data-injectable=true>But how this began seems to be unclear as well: there is no ground zero for this trend other than perhaps internet users attempting to “Mandela effect” and gaslight their peers into believing it. Quickly, reaction memes were posted on TikTok around this premise of an outbreak.</p><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=290 data-injectable=false>In a pandemic-riddled world, it’s also a curious commentary on how Western nations view China and the underlying fear born out of obvious misinformation. The internet age has allowed information to spread faster than ever, and paradoxically given misinformation even more of a spread.</p><p data-characters=120 data-current-count=410 data-injectable=false>Let’s be clear: there are <strong>no </strong>zombies in China. If there were, you’d probably not find out via TikTok anyway.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8uLTYZpuonaNiwaq306iiZqyYnrusedmopJuhlah6or7EZqmupp6eu6h5y6imrJ1dnrtur8eipZplkaG5brvFZphmq6WZsaa6jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./vanilla-french-toast.html><span>←</span><span>Vanilla French Toast Modern Honey</span></a>
