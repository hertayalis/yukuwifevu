There’s been no official confirmation at all that the live-action film is actually happening, but that hasn’t stopped fans and netizens from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">speculating about the story and characters</a>. And artist Camille Vialet clearly took the concept and ran with it in the below Spider-Verse fan art, which includes various iterations of the live-action Spideys. The OG Tobey Maguire suit is one of the inspirations, as are Tom Holland’s MCU suits, and they’re joined by Spider-Gwen and Miles Morales, too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/116910666_967510463765602_4695669507455511047_n.jpg><p data-characters=496 data-current-count=496 data-injectable=true>The existence of Miles has been discreetly hinted at in the film continuity, as we’ve seen his uncle Aaron Davis, played by Donald Glover, on screen. But more importantly, Davis even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">mentions his nephew’s name in a deleted scene</a> from Spider-Man: Homecoming. So, it stands to reason that Marvel Studios has, or had, plans for another Spider-Man to enter the fray at some point. And while the MCU has yet to introduce Gwen Stacy into the mix, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marvel reportedly have plans to add her in</a> as well.</p><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=298 data-injectable=false>In any case, it’s a great time to be a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spider-Man</a> fan, with the <strong>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse </strong>sequel on the way in 2022, as well as another Marvel Studios web-head movie featuring Tom Holland scheduled for 2021. And we’re sure that there’ll be more to come after that as well.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoqqmhlJq%2Ft7HRrJxmpJmrsqKv06Kmp2WWlrturdGtZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brynn-cameron.html><span>←</span><span>Former USC Trojans' Shooting Guard, Brynn Cameron shares Two Children with Ex-Boyfriend Blake Griffi</span></a>
