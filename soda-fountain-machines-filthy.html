I will never do it again," said a TikTok user named Brynn (<a href=# style=text-align:left rel="noopener noreferrer">@brynnnniethepooh</a>) in a video.</p><p>She explained that her car was recently having issues so she went into the fast food restaurant to get some water.

I don't know if it's from sitting in the heat, but I ain't never seen water do that so something ain't right," she said as she ended her video.</p><p>In her caption, she corrected herself to note that she had gotten the water from Wendy's and not Arby's.</p><p>Viewers had all sorts of things to say about Brynn's sus soda fountain water.</p><p>"My mom was the ONLY one who ever cleaned the soda nozzle where she worked and it was caked with mold when she started ... guys clean the nozzles," remarked one user.</p><p>Another, who claimed to work for Coca-Cola wrote, "Looks like syrup lines were mixed into the water lines.
