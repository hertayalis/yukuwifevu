That being said, one match is a huge topic of conversation right now.</p><p><a href=#>Click here for our complete coverage of AEW Dynamite this week.</a></p><p>On the August 16 edition of AEW Dynamite, Leatherface made a memorable appearance in a match that is being hailed as a contender for Match of the Year. In the Texas Chainsaw Massacre match, Jeff Jarrett emerged victorious against Jeff Hardy. This thrilling encounter has garnered widespread praise and has left viewers thoroughly impressed, with no criticisms raised by anyone who witnessed this epic showdown.</p><p>As the match reached its climax, Leatherface, the star of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, unexpectedly emerged and chased a group of heels backstage. Subsequently, the identity of the individual portraying the iconic horror movie character has been revealed.</p><p>Sean Sapp noted behind Fightful’s paywall that the man behind that Leatherface mask was Dean Alexander. He has been with AEW for a couple of years, but this might be his biggest role so far.</p><p>Fightful Select has learned that Dean Alexander portrayed the role of Leatherface for the event. Alexander has been wrestling for All Elite Wrestling for about two and a half years, first appearing at the March 2021 AEW Dark tapings. He’s worked at least three dozen dates since then, and regularly teamed with Rosario Grillo and Carlie Bravo. Perhaps his most prominent match was teaming with Kidd Bandit against Too Fast, Too Fuego.</p><p>As we <a href=#>previously reported,</a> AEW secured sponsorships exceeding $100,000 for the segment, and Tony Khan generously donated this amount to food banks to aid the Maui wildfires relief effort.</p><p>We will have to see if AEW does any cross-promotion in the future. If anything, they can always see if Dean Alexander can keep playing Leatherface, because Tony Khan might be able to use that character again.</p><p>What’s your take on this situation with AEW bringing in Leatherface? Sound off in the comments to let us know what you think!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><span class=author-name>Felix Upton</span> <span></span><p>Felix Upton is a seasoned writer with over 30 years of experience.
