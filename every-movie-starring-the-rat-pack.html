According to <a href=#>TCM</a>, this was directed by none other than Jerry Lewis (<a href=#>Britannica</a> notes it's actually the only film the legendary comic directed but did not appear in), which adds a bit of extra Rat Packiness to it due to Lewis's longtime association with Dean Martin.</p><p>The story is pretty dumb: After losing their club, Salt and Pepper ask Pepper's wealthy twin brother for help, only to find him murdered. Pepper naturally assumes his identity, as one does (per <a href=#>Radio Times</a>). As noted by <a href=#>Senses of Cinema</a>, why Lewis agreed to direct this film is a bit of a mystery, and even Lewis superfans admit it's not very good. The humor is pretty broad, as in a sequence where Davis takes some snuff and emits a series of sneezes so powerful they knock people over and destroy property.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCDkWxqaWlfmsOmvthmpKiumZp6tMDAq6mippdiwamxjKuYrWWglrCsew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./20091008920.html><span>←</span><span>Emma Bunton - Biography</span></a>
