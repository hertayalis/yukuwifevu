She wrote in her memoir Dolly Parton, Songteller: My Life in Lyrics that her appearances on The Porter Wagoner Show really started it all.</p><p>“I wear my <a href=# rel=noopener>high heels and my hair as high</a> as I can get it. I always wore my hair all teased up. Whenever that style started, I was the first to get my hair all poofy,” she recalled. “Then, as soon as I could buy those hairpieces and wigs, I wanted them. For one thing, they were so handy. Plus, my hair would never do exactly what I wanted it to do. So the wigs became kind of my trademark.”</p><p>She added, “When I was on ‘The Porter Wagoner Show,’ we had makeup girls. They would do their basics, and then I would add on to that. I was always into makeup, but I never could stand anybody else’s version of me.”</p><p>Ahead of <a href=# rel=noopener>Parton’s</a> 78th birthday on Jan 19, let’s take a look back at some of her most iconic hairstyles over the years.
