To begin hearing through walls, get a drinking glass with a broad rim and place it next to your ear. Afterwards, place the rim of the glass on the wall through which you want to listen and lay your ear on the bottom of it. Sound waves will pass through the wall and into the glass, allowing you to hear more clearly through it!
