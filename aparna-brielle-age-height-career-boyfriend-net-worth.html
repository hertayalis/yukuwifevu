The name of her parents is <strong>Partha Rajagopal</strong> and <strong>Girija Parthasarathy</strong>. Other than this, she also has a brother named <strong>Vijay</strong>. Sources suggest she hails from Indian origin. The family ties, however, were pretty intense.</p><p>Added to that, Aparna belongs to American nationality but is associated with Indian descent. Likewise, the ethnicity of this actress is mixed. Her zodiac sign, however, is Aquarius.</p><h2>Age and Body Measurements</h2><p>Aparna was born in 1994, which makes her 25 years old as of now. She stands at the height of 5’5″ and weighs 54 kgs. In the end, the mixed descent tends to make her look pretty with some causal makeup at times. But sadly, there is no information about the vital body statistics.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lindy Booth Age, Height, Career, Husband, Net Worth, Wiki >></a></h4><p>Other than the available measurements, this American nation has a charming pair of brown eyes, and the hair colour is also of the same colour.</p><h2>Early Life and Education</h2><p>Aparna was born in Clackamas but spent most of her childhood in Cedar Mills of Portland with her family and siblings. Brielle was pretty close to her family, and most of her childhood needs were fulfilled with ease by her family. The freedom in the family culture allowed her the opportunity to become an actress.</p><p>For her educational background through the brown-eyed lady attended Valley Catholic School and was interested in dancing from a very early age. After the schooling, the dancer joined Arts and Communications in High School and majored in marketing at Linfield College. It is surprising for most that a marketing graduate went to do be a proficient actress.</p><h2>Aparna Brielle Career</h2><p>If a career takes up and down to find people in the opposite direction with time, then surely Aparna is well known about this. A marketing student is the talk of the town in the field of acting at this point.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/aparna-1358.jpg><p>The debut came in the year 2011 in a short movie Dinner with Wendy, and the next year Sunshine Girl and Hunt for the Black Eyed Kids also hit the audience. In the year 2014 came the role in drama Grimm, which made her a recognizable face, and The Librarians, Cooper Barrett’s Guide to Surviving Life, also provided the required push.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ashley Laurence Bio- Age, Height, Hellraiser, Slipknot, Married >></a></h4><p>With some big and small roles around till this point in time, the highly recognizable part is surely in A.P. Bio, where she portrays <strong>Sarika Sarkar</strong>. Many of the viewers might also have noticed her in the famous series Friends with the purpose of <strong>Leslie Buffay</strong>. Brielle is finding her feet in acting, and we feel there is undoubtedly more to come from her.</p><h2>Boyfriend</h2><p>Aparna Brielle is single, and this might also be good news for the young hearts who might be dreaming about her. Not only at this point, but there has hardly been any name associated with her in the case of a boyfriend.</p><p>It might be due to the focus being all shifted towards building a legacy in acting. Elsewhere this brown-haired lady might be dating someone under the radar. Whatever might be the case but we can say with assurance that Brielle is a pretty close friend of Harley Quinn Smith.</p><h2>Aparna Brielle Net Worth</h2><p>Aparna is just a newbie in the acting industry who is steadily finding big leaps and bounds. There might have been multiple roles, but the recognizable character is portrayed in only one. As of 2019, the net worth of Aparna is not known to the general people.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wallis Currie Wood Age, Height, Career, Boyfriend, Net Worth >></a></h4><p>The secrecy to the top has made it hard to scroll out any detail. Unfortunately, nothing of accuracy can be found on the annual income count or the assets owned. We feel something soon will pop up, and we will let you all know.</p><h2>Social Media Reach</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Instagram</a>– 22k followers</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Twitter</a>– 6900 followers</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmispqi1sMPSrZirq16YvK57wKmYq6aRYq%2BztcSlo55lkZyybrTEop6hrF2YrrOxxKtkm6epm7%2Bqsc2dZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./persona-6-release-date.html><span>←</span><span>Atlus is Definitely Going to Make 'Persona 6' Here's What We Know About a Release Date</span></a>
