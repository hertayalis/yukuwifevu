Everyone knows that Erica Mena is a fighter and she’ll stoop as low as it takes to win. So Mena threw down the gloves and blasted Bow Wow with accusations that he was abusive to Chavis.</p><p>Apparently Erica moved out of Shad’s house a little over a month ago but never really had it out publically (which is very unusual for Mena.) The former BET star and his reality star girlfriend threw enough hints on social media that many assumed they were working on their relationship and a reunion announcement was expected at any time.</p><p>If there was any doubt that Erica Mena and Bow Wow are over for good, there isn’t any now. Mena spoke to Global Grind after the blowup online. Mena didn’t mince words and we hope she’s being honest because the allegations she waged against the CSI: Cyber actor are pretty serious.</p><p>Mena told Global Grind, “I’m not going to sit there and let my child see me be mistreated by a man.” Mena claims that Shad Moss trying to mistreat her and that he had been abusive with his baby mama Chavis, Erica went on to say, “I’ve been quiet about it because we were engaged, but obviously he was in his feelings after my Snapchat post.”</p><p>Mena claimed that Bow Wow was really trying to get under her skin by letting the reality star know that he was hanging out with Joie Chavis again. Of course Mena claims it didn’t work but then she unleashed a whole lot of fury. We’re guessing Mena was really mad and that’s why she spilled the dirty details that she says Shad Moss is trying to keep quiet.</p><p>“I never wanted (his) business out there. I feel like people have seen me on reality TV having to fight, but at this point in my life, I deserve peace. I’m in a different place now. When it comes to Shad, this is the man I at one point really considered marrying. He is the one I decided to say yes to, but once the mask came off, I realized I had made a bad choice,” Mena confessed.</p><p>Then Erica Mena dropped an even bigger bomb on us. The former Love & Hip Hop: New York troublemaker confirmed that she is no longer on the show. It’s looking like Erica has no plans to be on another reality show either. Mena has made it pretty clear that right now all she wants is for Bow Wow to leave her alone and let her just have some peace and quiet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaG5nlae2pK2MppynmV2WsKTB0p6qZpqfrHq4u9Zmpp9lkpqutbXNoGSwp52au261zWarsKGkqbKzecGaq62klWLBs7vUm6OenF2YvLa8y55krKicnsFuss6rZKCnn5l8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./eddie-lucas.html><span>←</span><span>Eddie Lucas</span></a>
