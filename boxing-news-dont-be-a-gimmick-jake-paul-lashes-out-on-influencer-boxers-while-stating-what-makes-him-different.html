<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Dont Be a Gimmick: Jake Paul Lashes Out on Influencer Boxers While StatingWhat Makes Him Diff</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The journey is now almost five years old. The enfant terrible of influencer boxing has entered the big league. <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><strong>Jake Paul</strong></a> faces <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><strong>Nate Diaz</strong></a> on Saturday night at the American Airlines Center. Now, as he looks back and watches the inrush of an increasing number of YouTubers and Internet personalities queuing up for a taste of the slugfest, ‘The Problem Child’ doesn’t seem too pleased with the screenplay of the plot. Instead, he would rather read the riot act to many newcomers who have purportedly made a mess of the influencer boxing scene.</p><p>So Jake Paul spoke his heart out to <strong>BoxingScene</strong> on the current developments in influencer boxing. Grossly disturbed by misbehavior, such as the female boxer who exposed herself in the ring, ‘The Problem Child,’ said convincing the influencers and YouTubers to clean up their act is tough.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong>Jake Paul cautions influencer boxers who want to make it big</strong></h2><p>It may not be his job to persuade them, either. However, bringing them around the idea of attracting new fans without resorting to cheap tricks is a big challenge. <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>He shared with BoxingScene</a>, “…. It’s just tough because we want to create new eyeballs for the sport but don’t want it to be a gimmick. Don’t be a gimmick…” According to Paul, the influencers should get into boxing seriously by starting at a gym.</p><p>Then, giving his example, he said that even though he indulged in trash-talking, he could back it up. So over the years, he knocked out some of the biggest names in the combat sports arena. He continued, “So focus more on your skill level versus doing these crazy PR stunts.” Jake Paul further explained why he is no longer a part of YouTube boxing. He said, “I’m&nbsp;not in the YouTube boxing world. That whole like crazy, tag-team style stuff, influencers versus influencers… I’m not in that world. My cards are filled with world champions, the best of the best and highest levels of competition.” So he contends that others could follow a similar path.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/imago1011689697h.jpg><p>It may be trendy to fight elites in the business. But Paul insists the new influencer boxers should focus on taking their skills to the next level. However, Paul added a hint of caution to his admiration for the sport, saying, “…A lot of the stuff that they are doing … these girls flashing and taking their tops off in the ring, all of this stuff is a bit too much.”</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong>The journey, till he met a boxer</strong></h2><p><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Jake Paul has reached a juncture where a misstep might result in questions about his future in boxing</a>. But it’s interesting how a YouTuber enjoying massive success in content creation took up the gloves. Within a decade, he reached a stage that may otherwise take even a seasoned pro boxer many years. Debuting as a professional on January 30, 2020, Paul had been on a rollercoaster ride, winning all his bouts. Most of his opponents were professional fighters at the top of their trade.</p><p>But he drew flak from many quarters for cherry-picking opponents. Hence to quash any more doubts about his skills and establish his credentials as a serious boxer, Paul took on <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><strong>Tommy Fury</strong></a> on February 26 this year. But sadly, the match didn’t go his way despite the eighth-round knockdown of Fury.</p><p>Do you agree with what Jake Paul said about the recent entrants in the influencer boxing genre?
