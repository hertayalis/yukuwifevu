Jess had a kind heart and was a devoted wife, mother, sister, aunt, friend, and partner. She was a writer, a health advocate, a dreamer with goals, and just a lovely, kind, spirited person. She also had a deliciously offbeat sense of humor.</p><p>Jess was very concerned about her health and spent a lot of time studying even the tiniest details so that she and her loved ones would be better off.</p><p>As demonstrated by her words, laughter, and array of colorful clothing, she was the brightest and most colorful light in any space.</p><p>Family and acquaintances were dear to Jess. They and everyone who encountered them are aware of how much Jessica loved her husband Mike and how much Mike loved Jess. Their relationship dates back almost 26 years. They did everything together and shared a unique and imaginative love and relationship that was filled with laughter. They had aspirations and objectives for the future. Her death is utterly devastating.</p><p>These money will be applied to funeral and administrative costs. Even better if we can create a safety net to aid Mike in navigating the coming days. We sincerely appreciate your help at this difficult moment. Please think about giving; any sum will be a real help to Mike at this challenging time.</p><p>Thanks for reading from <a href=# rel=noopener>Ghsplash</a> a news publishing website from Ghana.
