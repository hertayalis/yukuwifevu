While observing Ash Wednesday and Friday's during lent, people refrain from eating meat which is why local churches hold fish fries during the season. Saint Francis of Assisi was very busy Wednesday afternoon as the community stopped by to pick up dinners. The church started taking orders on Tuesday and they have been working hard ever since.</p><p>"We have been super busy today. We have to work in time slots so we can allocate the fish and make sure that things are ready when it should be and good quality without getting cold or anything," said Robert Bimeal, Volunteer at the fish fry.<br></p><p>Volunteers at the church have been busy preparing for Ash Wednesday all week, but due to supply chain issues, orders for fish and other supplies necessary for the fish fry to be successful had to be placed weeks ago.</p><p>"We started placing orders about three or four weeks ago to be guaranteed that we are getting supplies. We had the food delivered earlier than normal only because we wanted to make sure, if at the last minute, we did not have sufficient product we could get it somewhere else," explained Barbara Bimeal, Coordinator for the fish fry.</p><p>In past years, the church had a fish fry every Friday during Lent, but this year had to cut down on the number of weeks due to those supply chain issues and an increase in price for fish and other supplies.</p><p>"The fish almost doubled in price, the other prices went up 30-40%, so we were very vigilant of watching our prices," said Barbara Bimeal.</p><p>This year the church will continue hosting their fish fry as a take-out only event due to the pandemic. The fish fry is still one of the biggest fundraisers for the church and the money raised will be put to good use.</p><p>"Some things come up that are capital expenses that just crop up and you're not expecting them and we have one or two of those now so we will be able to put the money to good use to keep the church stable, well kept, and the doors open," said Robert Bimeal.</p><p>Through it all, the church is grateful that the community and volunteers continually come out to support the event.</p><p>"We're just thankful for the community and all the workers here that have put time in to support us and guide us and for the good lord to bless us with a beautiful day to have everybody here with a happy face on," said Barbara Bimeal.</p><p>Saint Francis of Assisi still has a few more fish fries coming up this season. They are tentatively scheduled for Friday March 18 and Friday April 8. They will be take out only and orders must be placed by phone at 814-539-3518.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmpawtcKNnKamZ56axLR7y6iamqRfobykrctmmqGtopi1br%2FTmqmtq12ks6d5y56lrZ2eYsCmrdKopWavmam1brLIrJ9mnqKu</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chita-rivera-husband-is-chita-rivera-married.html><span>←</span><span>Chita Rivera Husband: Is Chita Rivera Married?</span></a>
