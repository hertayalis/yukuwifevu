They couldn't have done it without you," said Gary S. Gronseth, M.D., chair of the department, during congratulatory remarks. "On a personal note, there's a proud feeling that the parents, spouses and children have for the graduates. My grandson, who just turned 1-year-old, just started to walk. It's great, right? That feeling is exactly the feeling that your parents and loved ones have about your accomplishments, and it's exactly the feeling that the faculty has, so congratulations."</p><p>In addition to honoring graduates, the department took time to recognize the winners of its Research Day.</p><ul><li>Gloria Ortiz-Guerrero, M.D., PGY-2 (Mentor: Carol Ulloa, M.D)</li><li>Mai Yamakawa, M.D., PGY-3 (Mentor: Jeffrey Statland, M.D.)</li><li>Shweta Goswami, M.D., PGY-4 (Mentor: Michael Abraham, M.D.)</li><li>Vishal Saini, M.D., PGY-4 (Mentor: Deetra Ford, M.D.)</li><li>Tim Fullam, M.D., Neuromuscular Medicine Fellow (Mentor: Jeffrey Statland, M.D.)</li></ul><p>As part of Research Day, a long-running annual tradition in the department, residents and fellows present research projects they developed in collaboration with faculty mentors.
