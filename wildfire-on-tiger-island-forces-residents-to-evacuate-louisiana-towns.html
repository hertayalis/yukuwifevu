Greg Abbott said he has deployed 89&nbsp;firefighters, paramedics and emergency management personnel along with emergency response resources to Louisiana to help combat the devastating wildfires currently burning near the Texas-Louisiana border and across the Pelican State.</p><p>“Texas has deployed&nbsp;firefighters, emergency response personnel, and resources to help our neighbors in Louisiana respond to devastating wildfires,” Abbott said. “Just as the State of Louisiana offered their support and assistance during Hurricane Harvey six years ago, Texas is swiftly providing the personnel and resources our neighbors need to combat these destructive wildfires impacting their state.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘Biggest fire danger’ since 2000</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-style-default">More than 30,000 acres have burned in the Tiger Island fire. <span class=credit>Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-style-default">Air tankers&nbsp;and helicopters are dropping water and&nbsp;fire retardant&nbsp;on the blaze. <span class=credit>Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry</span></figure><p>High temperatures, drought and variable winds prompted the NWS to issue a Fire Weather&nbsp;Warning&nbsp;through Friday night for critical to extreme fire weather conditions.</p><p>“This is rapidly becoming the biggest fire danger threat this area has had since the summer of 2000,” the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">National Weather Service office in Lake Charles office warned</a>. “Fires can spread rapidly in these conditions.”</p><p>It’s not just flames firefighters face but extreme heat.</p><p>Merryville hit a high of 109 on Thursday.
